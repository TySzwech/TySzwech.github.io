  <h1>Site dedicated to Malenia, Blade of Miquella</h1>
  <p>Malenia, Blade of Miquella (1st phase)/Malenia, Goddess of Rot (2nd phase) is a Boss in Elden Ring. <p>
  <p>Malenia was born as a twin to Miquella, the most powerful of the Empyreans. She is renowned for her legendary battle against Starscourge Radahn during the Shattering, during which she unleashed the power of the Scarlet Rot, reducing Caelid to ruins.
 Wielding a prosthetic arm and leg, Malenia is located in Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree. This boss is optional, as players do not need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring.
 Malenia is a difficult end-game boss and players may have difficulty avoiding damage from her Waterfowl Dance move in particular. Her poise is low, however, which players should make use of to interrupt some of her attacks.
 She drops the Remembrance of the Rot Goddess and Malenia's Great Rune when defeated.<p>
